# Frontend Developer | React, UX, CRO Expert
I am a frontend developer with **over 10 years of experience** specializing in high-performance **UI and UX design**, with a strong focus on **conversion rate optimization** (CRO). Currently, I leverage my skills in **Javascript** and **Javascript frameworks** to develop impactful **A/B tests** and build **web applications**.

I take pride in building interfaces and applications that people love to use and my passion for user experience inspires me to continue growing my skillset every day.
